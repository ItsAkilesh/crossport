# Changelog

Versioning: `0.<milestone>.<patch>` while Crossport is pre-1.0. The minor number is the roadmap milestone
being worked on. A feature commit that adds user-visible capability (a new flag, a new class of program
that runs) bumps the patch number; a fix does not. The version lives in `translator/Cargo.toml` and is
bumped in the same commit as the change. Releases are tagged by the maintainer, not by automation.

## 0.6.0

- `--stub-missing` for `translate` and `convert`: libraries and symbols that nobody provides are bound to
  a shim stub that returns 0, and the translator lists what it stubbed.
- In-process Xlib and xcb in the shim: windows, events, keyboard, properties, drawing, images.
- SDL2 window sample added to the corpus (Milestone 6).
